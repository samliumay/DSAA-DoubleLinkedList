# DSAA-DoubleLinkedList
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. Its also usefull who wants to basically learn data structures and algorithms. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Basic explanation of how DoubleLinkedList works.
* Complexitys of the methods of Double Linked list like insert, delete ext.
* Explanations are integrated inside the codes. So by rewritting the code with comments, you will able to have at least a basic understanding of DoubleLinkedLists.

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* Explanation of double linked list more detailed and from scratch. 
* Explanation of the linkedlist operations complexities deeply. 
* Turkish and English versions are available.
