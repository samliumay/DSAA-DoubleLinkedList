# DSAA-DoubleLinkedList
* DSAA = Data Structures and Algorithms 

## Introduction 
* As a data structures and algorithms fan, I wanted to create a lesson series for people who are trying to pass Data structres and Algorithms courses. Its also usefull who wants to basically learn data structures and algorithms. The video explanations are at my superpeer. 

## What is included at this page and inside the codes? 
* Basic explanation of how DoubleLinkedList works.
* Complexitys of the functions like insert delete ext.
* Explanations are integrated inside the codes. So by rewritting the code with comments, you will able to have at least a basic understanding of DoubleLinkedLists.

## What do you explain at superpeer?
* I will explain all DoubleLinkedlists concept from scratch. 
* I will write everythink by explaining one by one from scratch. 
* You will have Turkish and English versions of the lessons. Depends to you which one you will choose. 

## Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samliumay/DSAA-LinkedList.git
cd src/main/java/Main.java
javac DoubleLinkedList.java Node.java Main.java
java Main.java
